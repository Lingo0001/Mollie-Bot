# Mollie Bot

## Multi Purpose Discord Bot

This bot is out of date now. I had finished working on it a few years ago now but only just made it public. Downloading this and running it won't work... I didn't want my token public Lol. 

If anything isn't correct or could be done better, any help is always appreciated :) This was made as a learning tool to Python for me, so I expect a thousand ways of improving it Lol.

## Requirements:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3+</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">Discord.py</a> + <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus">Menus</a></li>
</ul>
